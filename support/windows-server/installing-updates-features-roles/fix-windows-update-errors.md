## Common corruption errors

Windows updates may fail to install if there are corruption errors. You can check the Setup event log for errors. The following table lists the possible error codes for Windows Update for your reference:

|Code|Error|Description|
|---|---|---|
|0x80070002|ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND|The system cannot find the file specified.|
|0x800f0831|CBS_E_STORE_CORRUPTION|CBS store is corrupted.|
|0x8007000D|ERROR_INVALID_DATA|The data is invalid.|
|0x800F081F|CBS_E_SOURCE_MISSING|The source for the package or file not found.|
|0x80073712|ERROR_SXS_COMPONENT_STORE_CORRUPT|The component store is in an inconsistent state.|
|0x800736CC|ERROR_SXS_FILE_HASH_MISMATCH|A component's file does not match the verification information present in the component manifest.|
|0x800705B9|ERROR_XML_PARSE_ERROR|Unable to parse the requested XML data.|
|0x80070246|ERROR_ILLEGAL_CHARACTER|An invalid character was encountered.|
|0x8007370D|ERROR_SXS_IDENTITY_PARSE_ERROR|An identity string is malformed.|
|0x8007370B|ERROR_SXS_INVALID_IDENTITY_ATTRIBUTE_NAME|The name of an attribute in an identity is not within the valid range.|
|0x8007370A|ERROR_SXS_INVALID_IDENTITY_ATTRIBUTE_VALUE|The value of an attribute in an identity is not within the valid range.|
|0x80070057|ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER|The parameter is incorrect.|
|0x800B0100|TRUST_E_NOSIGNATURE|No signature was present in the subject.|
|0x80092003|CRYPT_E_FILE_ERROR|An error occurred while Windows Update reads or writes to a file.|
|0x800B0101|CERT_E_EXPIRED|A required certificate is not within its validity period when verifying against the current system clock or the time stamp in the signed file.|
|0x8007371B|ERROR_SXS_TRANSACTION_CLOSURE_INCOMPLETE|One or more required members of the transaction are not present.|
|0x80070490|ERROR_NOT_FOUND|Windows could not search for new updates.|
|0x800f0984|PSFX_E_MATCHING_BINARY_MISSING|Matching component directory exist but binary missing|
|0x800f0986|PSFX_E_APPLY_FORWARD_DELTA_FAILED|Applying forward delta failed|
|0x800f0982|PSFX_E_MATCHING_COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND|Can't identify matching component for hydration|

For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The DISM may help you fix some Windows corruption errors.

## Using DISM to repair Windows Update corruptions

> [!NOTE]
> The solution mentioned in this section applies to Modern Windows versions like Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows Server 2016, or later.

To resolve Windows Update corruptions and address update installation failures, use the DISM tool. Then, install the Windows Update.

1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, open the **Start** menu or **Start** screen, type _Command Prompt_, right-click **Command Prompt**, and then select **Run as administrator**. If you're prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or select **Allow**.

2. Type the following command, and then press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.

    ```console
    DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
    ```

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > DISM repair works best when you connect to Microsoft Update servers to fetch missing or corrupted files. When you use the proceeding command, DISM gets the files needed to fix any corruptions from Windows Update. However, if your computer can't connect to Windows Update, you can alternatively use a working Windows installation as the repair source, or you can use files from a Windows folder on a network or from a USB or DVD. Instead, use this command:

    ```console
    DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:\\<servername>\c$\winsxs /LimitAccess
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace \<servername\> with the computer name of the computer you are using as a repair source. The repair source computer must be running the same Operating System version. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference [Repair a Windows Image](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-8.1-and-8/hh824869(v=win.10)). If the scan result is "The restore operation completed successfully", go to the next step. If not, try to fix errors found in the CBS log file.

3. Type the `sfc /scannow` command and press Enter. It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.

4. Close the command prompt, and then run **Windows Update** again.

DISM creates a log file (_%windir%\\Logs\\CBS\\CBS.log_) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. _%windir%_ is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the _%windir%_ folder is _C:\\Windows_.

## How does DISM Repair work?

DISM is a command-line tool that is used to service and repair Windows images, including the Windows Recovery Environment, Windows Setup, and Windows PE (WinPE). It can also be used to repair the local Windows image on your computer.

To give you a better understanding, here's a summary of the resources that the DISM tool checks for integrity:

- Files that are located in the following directories:
  - _%SYSTEMROOT%\Servicing\Packages_
  - _%SYSTEMROOT%\WinSxS\Manifests_
- Registry data that's located under the following registry subkeys:
  - _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Components_
  - _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Schema_
  - _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing_

This list may be updated at any time. When the DISM detects incorrect manifests, Cabinets, or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with a corrected version.

### Logging

The DISM tool creates a log file that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. The log file is located here:

- _%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log_
- _%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CBS.persist.log_

## Fix corruptions found in CBS.log file

To manually fix corruption errors that the DISM tool detects but can't fix, follow these steps:

1. Open _%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log_.

    > [!NOTE]
    > _%SYSTEMROOT%_ is an environment variable that saves the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, generally, the _%SYSTEMROOT%_ folder is _C:\Windows_.

2. Identify the packages that the tool can't fix. For example, you may find the following information in the log file:

    ```output
   Checking System Update Readiness.
    (p)	CSI Payload Corrupt			(n)	    	amd64_microsoft-windows-a..modernappmanagement_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19041.3636_none_23b3b3ece690d77b\EnterpriseModernAppMgmtCSP.dll
	(p)	CBS MUM Missing				(n)			Microsoft-Windows-Client-Features-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.19041.4291
	(p)	CSI Manifest Corrupt		(w)	(Fixed)	wow64_microsoft-windows-audio-mmecore-acm_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19041.1_none_a12b40f4b4c7b751

    Summary:
    Operation: Detect and Repair
    Operation result: 0x800f081f
    Last Successful Step: Remove staged packages completes.
    Total Detected Corruption:	4

   - CSI Payload Corruption: This indicates that the payload file `EnterpriseModernAppMgmtCSP.dll` is corrupt.
   - CBS MUM Missing: A required MUM file is missing from the `Microsoft-Windows-Client-Features-Package`.
   - CSI Manifest Corruption: There were two instances of manifest corruption. One was fixed `(wow64_microsoft-windows-audio-mmecore-acm)`, and the other `(wow64_microsoft-windows-audio-volumecontrol)` remains corrupt.
